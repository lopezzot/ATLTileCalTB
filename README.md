# ATLTileCalTB
A Geant4 simulation of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter beam tests.

<b>This branch is for Geant4 version 10.1 with FTFP_BERT_ATL, which was used in the original ATLAS paper. Note that some features are disabled.</b>

This branch requires a patched version of Geant4 10.1, please see `FTFP_BERT_ATL_for_G4.10.1/README` for details. Note: you need [Xerces-C v2.8.0](https://github.com/apache/xerces-c/releases/tag/v2.8.0), which builds using autoconf in the `src/xercesc` folder.

<!--Geant Val integration-->
## Geant Val integration
[Geant Val](https://geant-val.cern.ch/) is the Geant4 testing and validation suite. It is a project hosted on [gitlab.cern.ch](https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation) used to facilitate the maintenance and validation of Geant4 applications, referred to as <em>tests</em>.\
The following are instructions to use ATLTileCalTB within Geant Val, from batch submission to website deployment.
1. **On lxplus**, clone ATLTileCalTB and the Geant Val geant-config-generator
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lopezzot/ATLTileCalTB
   git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation/geant-config-generator.git
   ```
2. [Follow the build instructions on lxplus](#build-compile-and-execute-on-lxplus)
3. Copy the ATLTileCalTB geant val scripts into ```tests/geant4/```
   ```sh
   cp -r ATLTileCalTB/geantval_scripts/ATLTileCalTB/ geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/
   mkdir -p geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/ATLTileCalTB/files
   cp ATLTileCalTB/TileTB_2B1EB_nobeamline.gdml ATLTileCalTB/analysis/TBrun_all.C geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/ATLTileCalTB/files/
   ```
3. We will execute ATLTileCalTB via Geant Val using Geant4.10.7.p03, therefore we must make sure the file ```10.7.p03.sh``` exists in ```configs/geant/```. In the file ```10.7.p03.sh``` we also export the path to the ATLTileCalTB executable (compiled with 10.7.p03). \
   Copy the config file using:
   ```sh
   ./ATLTileCalTB/geantval_scripts/cpconf.sh \
      ATLTileCalTB/geantval_scripts/configs/10.7.p03.sh \
      geant-config-generator/configs/geant4/ \
      $(pwd)/ATLTileCalTB-build
   ```
4. Create macros and metadata for Geant Val execution
   ```sh
   cd geant-config-generator
   ./mc-config-generator.py submit -t ATLTileCalTB -d OUTPUT -v 10.7.p03 -q "testmatch" -r
   ```
   this command creates the Geant Val files for batch submission using HTCondor under the ```OUTPUT``` folder, using ATLTileCalTB, Geant4.10.7.p03 and the ```testmatch``` job flavour.
5. To monitor the jobs use
   ```sh
   ./mc-config-generator.py status -t ATLTileCalTB -d OUTPUT
   ```
   When the job execution ends, the root output files are stored in the corresponding job folder. Each job folder will look like this:
   ```
   ATLTileCalTB-env.log  test_stderr.txt  test_stdout.txt
   ATLTileCalTB.json  ATLTileCalTB.mac  ATLTileCalTBout_Run0.root
   ATLTileCalTB.sh  bsub.sh  config.sh  
   ```
6. Execute the analysis on the root files in the `OUTPUT` folder to create Geant Val JSON output files
   ```sh
   ./mc-config-generator.py parse -t ATLTileCalTB -d OUTPUT
   ```
   Make sure to source ROOT on CVMFS before, for example by sourcing the provided lxplus scripts.\
   Besides the JSON files in the `OUTPUTJSON` folder, the parser script will also create some
   temporary folder that contain the merged ROOT files for each run and the analysis output.
7. The last part is to deploy the results on Geant Val. The ATLTileCalTB layout on the Geant Val
   website is defined in the ATLTileCalTB.xml file on [gitlab.com/thegriglat/geant-val-layouts](https://gitlab.com/thegriglat/geant-val-layouts)
   (additional info are in the tags.json file).
   Deploy JSON files on the Geant Val database
   ```sh
    find . -name '*.json' | while read i; \
      do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "token: askauthor" --data @$i https://geant-val.cern.ch/upload; \
      echo; done
   ```

<!--CMake options-->
## CMake options
Custom options:
-  `BUILD_ANALYSIS`: if set to `ON` (default), it will be an executable of the analysis, which is
   slightly faster. The analysis can also be run directly with the `root` executable (see
   [Run the analysis](#run-the-analysis)), which is recommended if the compilation fails.
-  `WITH_ATLTileCalTB_PulseOutput`: if set to `ON`, the simulation will output the pulse response
   of the PMTs. These can be viewed by running `./pulse_viewer.py` in the build directory. Since
   this slows the simulation considerably, it is recommended to leave this option disabled except
   for debugging purposes.
-  `WITH_ATLTileCalTB_NoNoise`: if set to `ON`, the simulation will not put electronic noise on the
   signal (per cell) and disable the 2 sigma noise cut. Only relevant for noise calibration.
-  `WITH_GEANT4_UIVIS`: if set to `ON` (default), build with UI and visualization drivers.

Relevant built-in options:
-  `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: set to `Debug` for debugging and to `Release` for production (faster).
-  `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`: if `ON`, creates `compile_commands.json` in the build folder.
   Might help some syntax highlighters to properly parse the analysis script if building with
   `BUILD_ANALYSIS=ON`.
-  `Geant4_DIR`: set to the path containing the `Geant4Config.cmake` file of your Geant4 installation.
-  `ROOT_DIR`: set to the path containing th `ROOTConfig.cmake` of your ROOT installation. Only
   used if building with `BUILD_ANALYSIS=ON`.

<!--Run the analysis-->
## Run the analysis
1. For the analysis both electron and pion data is required, which can be obtained by running for example `ATLTileCalTB -m TBrun_all.mac`.
2. After the run, all the ROOT files and their containing TTree need to merged into a single file called `ATLTileCalTBout_All.root`. This can be done with `hadd`:
   ```sh
   hadd -f ATLTileCalTBout_RunAll.root ATLTileCalTBout_Run*.root
   ```
3. To run the analysis, execute the analysis macro in the folder containing the root file:
   ```sh
   root /path/to/ATLTileCalTB/analysis/TBrun_all.C
   ```
   Alternatively, the analysis marco can also be build as executable for slightly faster executation time.
4. The plots created during the analysis are stored in the `analysis.root` file.
