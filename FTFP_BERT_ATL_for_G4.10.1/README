These are the 6 files you need on top of Geant4 10.1 to get FTFP_BERT_ATL
(their directories show where they should be located):

1. physics_lists/lists/sources.cmake
  
2. physics_lists/lists/include/FTFP_BERT_ATL.hh

3. physics_lists/lists/include/FTFP_BERT_ATL.icc

4. physics_lists/constructors/hadron_inelastic/sources.cmake

5. physics_lists/constructors/hadron_inelastic/include/G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_ATL.hh

6. physics_lists/constructors/hadron_inelastic/src/G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_ATL.cc

Also, apply copynumbers.patch to source/persistency/gdml/src/G4GDMLReadStructure.cc
using `patch < copynumbers.patch` and enter the path to the file to be patched.
